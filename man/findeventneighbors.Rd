}
\arguments{
\item{date}{A vector of dates.}

\item{event}{A logical indicating if a day was an event.}

\item{days}{The number of days that must separate a given day from an event.}

\item{by}{A vector of ids or a matrix with columns as the id variables. The events will be 
found separately within each unique combination of id variables. This is optional.}
