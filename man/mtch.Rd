\usage{
mtch(date, casecontrol, matchvars = NULL, mahdoy = FALSE, caldays = Inf,
  by, ratio = 1, seed, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{A vector of dates.}

\item{casecontrol}{A vector where 1 indentifies events, 0 identifies potential controls, and 
\code{NA} represent non-event days that are not eligible to be matched (e.g. missing data, 
or excluded for some other reason).}

\item{matchvars}{A matrix where the columns represent variables that will be matched on using 
the Mahalanobis distrance and nearest neighbor.}

\item{mahdoy}{A logical indicating if the day of year should be included in the 
Mahalanobis-metric matching within the caliper. The default is FALSE. If TRUE then the 
distance to the treatment day based on day of year will be included with the other matching 
variables.}

\item{caldays}{The number of days that matched value will be selected from. This ignors year 
but only looks at date and month. For example, if caldays=7 then the pairs will be from 
within 7 days of the control (inclusive).}

\item{by}{A vector of ids or a matrix with columns as the id variables. The events will be 
found separately within each unique combination of id variables. This is optional.}

\item{ratio}{The number of control units to be matched to each case. The default is 1.  See 
documentation for \code{matchit} for more details.}

\item{seed}{A seed for a random number generator.}
}
\value{
data A \code{data.table} object of matched cases and controls.

nn A summary of the number if cases and controls that were matched. See documentation 
   for \code{matchit} for more details.

sum.matched A summary of the quality of each match. See documentation for 
   \code{matchit} for more details.
}
\description{
This function finds matches for the events without a strata and withing a time window. The 
Mahalanobis-metric can be used to match on other variables as well. It is a wrapper for the 
matchit function from the \code{MatchIt} package.
